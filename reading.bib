  abstract = {Abstract             Similar to the early days of the Internet, today, the effectiveness and applicability of legal regulations are being challenged by the advent of blockchain technology. Yet, unlike the Internet, which has evolved into an increasingly centralized system that was largely brought within the reach of the law, blockchain technology still resists regulation and is thus described by some as being ``alegal'', i.e., situated beyond the boundaries of existing legal orders and, therefore, challenging them. This article investigates whether blockchain technology can indeed be qualified as alegal and the extent to which such technology can be brought back within the boundaries of a legal order by means of targeted policies. First, the article explores the features of blockchain-based systems, which make them hard to regulate, mainly due to their approach to disintermediation. Second, drawing from the notion of alegality in legal philosophy, the article analyzes how blockchain technology enables acts that transgress the temporal, spatial, material, and subjective boundaries of the law, thereby introducing the notion of ``alegality by design''---as the design of a technological artifact can provide affordances for alegality. Third, the article discusses how the law could respond to the alegality of blockchain technology through innovative policies encouraging the use of regulatory sandboxes to test for the ``functional equivalence'' and ``regulatory equivalence'' of the practices and processes implemented by blockchain initiatives.},

In the process, it addresses how web-based practices challenge certain established museological values and precipitate alternative ways of understanding art's stewardship, curatorial responsibility, public access and art history. Through more than twenty interviews with artists and curators in the course of the last ten years, and flanked by an extensive timeline, the reader of this publication is given an insight into the discourse on digital art and its curation today},

Most importantly, Tezos supports meta upgrades: the protocols can evolve by amending their own code. To achieve this, Tezos begins with a seed protocol defining a procedure for stakeholders to approve amendments to the protocol, including amendments to the voting procedure itself. This is not unlike philosopher Peter Suber's Nomic[3], a game built around a fully introspective set of rules.},

They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when their market has experienced record sales, but little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate further research on NFT production, adoption, and trading in different contexts.},

  abstract = {Digital technology has revolutionized the way we produce and experience art today. Not only have traditional forms of art such as printing, painting, photography and sculpture been transformed by digital techniques and media, but entirely new forms such as internet art, software art, digital installation and virtual reality have emerged as recognized artistic practices. Christiane Paul surveys the developments in digital art from its appearance in the 1980s to the present day and looks ahead to what the future may hold. Drawing a distinction between work that uses digital technology as a tool to produce traditional forms and work that uses it as a medium to create new types of art, she discusses the key artists and works. The book explores themes addressed and raised by these artworks, such as viewer interaction, artificial life and intelligence, political and social activism, networks and telepresence, and issues surrounding the collection, presentation and preservation of digital art. This third, expanded edition investigates key areas of digital art practice that have gained in prominence in recent years, including the emergence and impact of locative media, interactive public installation, augmentive and mixed reality, social networking, and file-sharing and tablet technologies},

  publisher = {{Bloomsbury Publishing}},
  address = {{New York}},
  abstract = {When the Machine Made Art covers the reception and criticism of computer art from its emergence in 1963 to its crisis in 1989, when ideological differences fragment the art movement. The text begins by identifying the various divisions between the humanistic and scientific cultures that inform early criticism. The fact that the first computer art has military origins and is imbued with various techno-science mythologies, places the movement at odds with artworld orthodoxy. Yet, while mainstream art critics reproach computerized art, a comparison between similar art forms of the era, such as conceptual art, reveals that the criticism of computer art was motivated more by the fear of the machine than by aesthetics. Dr. Grant Taylor shows that social anxiety, often fueled by Cold War dystopianism, posited the computer as a powerful instrument in the overall subordination of the individual to the emerging technocracy. But even though anti-computer sentiment abated in the late 1970s, computer art did not find acceptance. The book illustrates how computer art's exponents, desiring artworld legitimacy, traced its lineage back to modernism. Conversely, in the 1980s, art theorists, employing the latest critical theory, began critiquing the assumptions of modernism, and thus viewed computer art's modernist history as hopelessly outdated. And yet other critics reconciled computer technology with the critical insights of postmodernism, viewing the computer as a pluralistic agent that could challenge modernist conventions. Nonetheless, while postmodernist criticism enabled the formation of new discourses for emerging digital arts, it left computer art, which was committed to modernist and techno-science philosophies, in a state of crisis Examines the cultural and critical response to computer art, by identifying the destabilizing forces that affect, shape, and eventually fragment the computer art movement},

Artists are also exploring finance as a medium in their work as a reflection on their own economies and practices. Through an analysis of artist projects and start-ups, this paper explores the new models and possibilities of blockchain for the economies of art.},
